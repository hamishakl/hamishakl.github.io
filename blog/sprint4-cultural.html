              <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
              <p>In this post I will describe how neuroplasticity is relevant to learning and touch on the growth mindset.</p>

                <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
                <p>It helps people enhance memory, enhance cognitive skills and also restore old or lost functions that may have been forgotten or ignored.</p>
                <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
                <p>
                    I will practice a lot. Practicing helps build thicker, stronger connections in the brain. Also the old idea of 
                    "use it or lose it" is something I will take on board. This could mean coding every day even if it's just a little bit on 
                    free code camp. <br> Another principal I can be mindful of is interference. Making sure to limit distractions and getting side tracked will help me learn.
                </p>
                <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get enough sleep. Your brain needs rest to reset connections that are important for your learning and also your memory</li>
                    <br><li>Reducing stress.</li><br>
                    <li>Exercising and maintaining a healthy diet. You defintely feel rusty and sluggish after a big meal of takeaways, so that's a big sign!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>
                <p>
                    It is the mindset that allows you to consistently grow via evaulation (from yourself and others), take creative risks, embracing
                    failure and keeping an open mind. It is relevant because without you are really limiting yourself by remaining fixed and I guess, stubborn.
                </p>
                <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
                <p>
                    Growing up I was always afraid of failure. As I'm sure most people are. But I was never afraid of taking risks. With risks though,
                    comes failure. So I learn't to actually embrace it and sometimes even anticipate it. This was just a natural learning curve for me growing up and it
                    is surprising to see that I implemented some of the growth mindset qualities already. It is also interesting to think about others and if they
                    have a growth mindset or a fixed one. 
                </p>
                <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
                <p>I will always keep an open mind and take critcism with a lot of respect and consideration. This is something I believe will help me a lot.</p>
