              <p>This is a post to reflect on my learning.</p>

                <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
                <p>I want to have a career in web development as I really enjoy working with HTML and CSS. I really enjoy the design aspect of it as well so it would be great to find a role that let me have some input on the design as well as the development side.</p>
                <p>Aside from websites I would also like to learn how to develop apps. We live in a constantly evolving world that is constantly finding ways to implement technology
                    into our daily lives so I'd love to contribute to that somehow.</p>
                <p>Another goal of mine is to open my own gym. Working out has always been a hobby of mine and it would be great to help others get in to shape and acheive their goals. I could also build the website for free ;)</p>

            <div class="reflection-q-a">
                <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
                </h3>
                <p>A big one for me would be patience. I tend to get impatient with myself and others causing me to rush things.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="reflection-q-a">
                <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations
                </h3>
                <p>I am a strong problem solver and love to analyze situations. However, like I previously mentioned I am pretty impatient at times so I have a bad habbit of ditching the plan and just winging it or learning on the fly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="reflection-q-a">
                <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I will make an effort to communicate well with others as well as encourage it. In regards to productivity I'll continue to make sure I am taking care of my health as that is a big factor for me. 
                    I am always more productive when I take the time to work out, eat properly and socialize. Or else I tend to get lazy and distracted.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="reflection-q-a">
                <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
                </h3>
                <p>I always google problems first and usually find a good answer quickly. However, if I can't find anything I will either ask a classmate or teacher.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="reflection-q-a">
                <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
                </h3>
                <p>A consistent effort and continued support throughout the programme.</p>

                <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
                </h3>
                <p>Me and my girlfriend carpool to the city so just making sure I pick her up on time is important. I may also have to work 1 - 2 days a week but I am yet to confirm my shifts. Hopefully I can just do one shift during the week and one on the weekend.</p>
